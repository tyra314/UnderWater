# UnderWater
A tiny mod for Minecraft, which prohibits placing of blocks under water

# Behaviour

If the player is in water, that include also wet feets, than he can only place blocks,
if there is an air block above the block, he'd like to place. Otherwise the placing is
rejected. 

If the player is under the influence of the water breathing potion, he can place blocks
like in vanilla. This can be changed with an option in the config file.


# Configuration
It has one option, which can be used to disable the ability of the player to actually place
blocks under water, if he has the water breathing potion effect.

This mean, you can use this mod in any pack, without asking for permission.
However, a heads up would be welcome :)
